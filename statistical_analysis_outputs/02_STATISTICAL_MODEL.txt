STATISTICAL MODEL SPECIFICATION
================================

Primary Research Question:
-------------------------
Do natural disasters affecting a company's facilities impact its financial performance?

Dependent Variable:
------------------
ROA (Return on Assets) = Net Income / Total Assets
    - Measures firm profitability
    - Common financial performance metric
    - Ranges from negative (losses) to positive (profits)

Key Independent Variable:
------------------------
AFFECTED_RATIO = Number of Exposed Facilities / Total Facilities
    - Follows Hsu et al. (2018) methodology
    - Ranges from 0 (no exposure) to 1 (all facilities exposed)
    - A facility is "exposed" if a SHELDUS disaster event occurred in its FIPS county

Control Variables:
-----------------
1. LOG_ASSETS = ln(Total Assets)
   - Controls for firm size
   - Larger firms may have more resources to absorb shocks

2. LEVERAGE = Total Debt / Total Assets
   - Controls for financial structure
   - High leverage may amplify disaster impacts

3. Year Fixed Effects (Models 2-3)
   - Controls for time-varying macroeconomic conditions
   - Accounts for COVID-19 period effects (2020-2021)

Regression Models:
-----------------

Model 1: Simple OLS
    ROA_it = β₀ + β₁(AFFECTED_RATIO_it) + ε_it

Model 2: With Firm Controls
    ROA_it = β₀ + β₁(AFFECTED_RATIO_it) + β₂(LOG_ASSETS_it) 
           + β₃(LEVERAGE_it) + ε_it

Model 3: With Year Fixed Effects
    ROA_it = β₀ + β₁(AFFECTED_RATIO_it) + β₂(LOG_ASSETS_it) 
           + β₃(LEVERAGE_it) + Σγ_t(YEAR_t) + ε_it

Where:
    i = firm identifier
    t = year
    β₁ = coefficient of interest (disaster impact)
    ε_it = error term

Estimation Method:
-----------------
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) with robust standard errors
- Cross-sectional analysis (firm-year observations)
- No clustering (each firm-year treated as independent)

Sample Restrictions:
-------------------
1. Manufacturing firms only (based on SIC codes)
2. 2016-2023 period (ensures post-crisis data quality)
3. Non-missing financial data (ROA, assets, leverage)
4. Successfully matched TRI-CRSP-Compustat records

Hypothesis:
----------
H₀: β₁ = 0 (No effect of disasters on ROA)
H₁: β₁ < 0 (Disasters negatively impact ROA)

Expected Sign: Negative
    - Disasters disrupt operations
    - Increase costs (repairs, insurance deductibles)
    - Reduce productivity
    
Actual Finding: β₁ ≈ 0 (null result)
    - Suggests manufacturing firms are resilient
    - May have insurance, geographic diversification
    - Contrasts with Hsu et al.'s broader sample results
