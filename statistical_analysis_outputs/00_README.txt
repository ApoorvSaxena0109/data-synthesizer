CONTENTS OF THIS DELIVERY
--------------------------

1. DATASET DESCRIPTION (01_DATASET_DESCRIPTION.txt)
   - Sample period: 2016-2023
   - Observations: 2,080 firm-years
   - Companies: 293 manufacturing firms
   - Data sources: TRI, SHELDUS, CRSP, Compustat

2. STATISTICAL MODEL SPECIFICATION (02_STATISTICAL_MODEL.txt)
   - Research question
   - Dependent variable: ROA
   - Key independent variable: AFFECTED_RATIO
   - Control variables: LOG_ASSETS, LEVERAGE, Year FE
   - Three model specifications
   - Hypothesis and findings

3. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS (03_DESCRIPTIVE_STATISTICS.csv/xlsx)
   - Summary statistics for all key variables
   - Mean, std dev, min, max, quartiles
   - N = 2,080 observations with complete data
   
4. EXPOSURE DISTRIBUTION (03b_EXPOSURE_DISTRIBUTION.csv/xlsx)
   - 49.3% no exposure
   - 15.5% low exposure (1-25%)
   - 16.4% medium exposure (26-50%)
   - 8.0% high exposure (51-75%)
   - 10.7% very high exposure (76-100%)

5. CORRELATION MATRIX (04_CORRELATION_MATRIX.txt)
   - Instructions for generating from actual data
   - Key relationships to examine
   - Expected patterns

6. REGRESSION RESULTS (05a-05d files)
   - Model 1: Simple OLS
     * AFFECTED_RATIO coefficient: -0.0016 (p=0.790)
     * R² = 0.000
   
   - Model 2: With Controls  
     * AFFECTED_RATIO coefficient: -0.0009 (p=0.872)
     * LOG_ASSETS: +0.0057*** (p<0.001)
     * LEVERAGE: -0.0971*** (p<0.001)
     * R² = 0.038
   
   - Model 3: With Year FE
     * AFFECTED_RATIO coefficient: +0.0042 (p=0.506)
     * Controls remain significant
     * R² = 0.050

KEY FINDINGS
------------
✓ NULL RESULT: Disasters do not significantly affect ROA in manufacturing firms
✓ Coefficient near zero across all specifications
✓ P-values > 0.50 in all models (not statistically significant)
✓ Control variables work as expected (size positive, leverage negative)
✓ Robust to model specification

INTERPRETATION
--------------
Manufacturing firms appear resilient to disaster exposure, likely due to:
- Insurance coverage
- Geographic diversification  
- Supply chain flexibility
- Asset fungibility

This contrasts with Hsu et al. (2018) findings for broader samples,
suggesting manufacturing sector has unique resilience characteristics.

DATA AVAILABILITY NOTE
----------------------
The complete dataset with all 2,080 observations is generated by running
Notebooks 1-5 in sequence. The notebooks are available in this repository:

- Data_Preparation_FIPS.ipynb
- Automated_Matching_FIPS.ipynb
- 03_manual_review_and_analysis.ipynb
- 04_disaster_exposure_analysis.ipynb
- 05_CLEAN_affected_ratio_baseline_regression.ipynb
- 06_ROBUSTNESS_CHECKS_CLEAN.ipynb

ROBUSTNESS CHECKS
-----------------
Notebook 6 (06_ROBUSTNESS_CHECKS_CLEAN.ipynb) contains additional analyses:
- Alternative outcome measures
- Different disaster definitions
- Subsample analyses by firm size
- Dynamic specifications (leads/lags)
- Placebo tests

All robustness checks confirm the null finding.
