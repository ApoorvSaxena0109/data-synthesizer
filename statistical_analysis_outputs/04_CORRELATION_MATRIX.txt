CORRELATION MATRIX NOTES:
------------------------
The correlation matrix should be calculated from the actual analysis dataset.
This requires access to the complete merged data with all 2,080 observations.

Key relationships to examine:
1. ROA vs AFFECTED_RATIO - Main relationship of interest
2. LOG_ASSETS vs ROA - Size effect on profitability
3. LEVERAGE vs ROA - Financial structure effect
4. AFFECTED_RATIO vs total_facilities - Exposure patterns by firm size
5. Multicollinearity among controls

Expected patterns:
- AFFECTED_RATIO vs ROA: Near-zero (based on null finding)
- LOG_ASSETS vs ROA: Positive (larger firms more profitable)
- LEVERAGE vs ROA: Negative (debt reduces profitability)
- LOG_ASSETS vs LEVERAGE: Positive (larger firms carry more debt)


CORRELATION MATRIX STRUCTURE:
================================================================================

Variables to include:
  - ROA
  - AFFECTED_RATIO
  - LOG_ASSETS
  - LEVERAGE
  - num_disasters
  - total_facilities

To generate: Run this code on the analysis_data DataFrame:
  corr_vars = ['ROA', 'AFFECTED_RATIO', 'LOG_ASSETS', 'LEVERAGE', 
               'num_disasters', 'total_facilities']
  correlation_matrix = analysis_data[corr_vars].corr()
  correlation_matrix.to_csv('correlation_matrix.csv')
